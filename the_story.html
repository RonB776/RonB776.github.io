            In Northwood 2023 8/16 8:30am the ###### damn clock rang, actually it beeped which is something strange because I have a clock that rings... oh I must have been really tired anyway,</br>
            I finally woke up, I went to the kitchen, I put toast on the fire while I went to brush my teeth, get dressed and smell the toast burning.. luckily I like the burnt part of the bread :)</br>
            Why do I tell you about every action I do? Maybe I will be less specific.</br>
    </p>
    <P>       
            Well, in the end I was ready and I left the house (Grand Ave 723) the time was 9:15am and I rode my bike to work.</br>
            You know "work" sounds very serious, but not when you work at a gas station (Northwoods Convenience) which is 10 minutes from my house, don't get me wrong, it's a good place and the boss is a nice guy but the dam is nothing at all...... #### #### Umm yes this is the moment I remember that I have an interview for an office job today at noon at 3:30pm, a taxi at 2:00pm so leave work at 1:00pm .. Ok I think everything is fine.</br>
    </p>
    <p>
        </br>
            Well then I arrived at Northwoods Convenience and started my boring shift, it's pretty boring to work here after all it's a gas station not that much happens here it's not like it's full of customers so it's pretty easy, too easy so the boss finds something for me to do... especially today :(</br>
        </br>
            After several cleanings of toilets and trauma from cats in tins, 13:00 arrived.</br>
            By the way my name is Sam</br>
            [Sam] : Bye boss, the shift is over and I have to get out of here!</br>
            [Boss] : Wait, who authorized you to go?</br>
            [Sam] : Don't worry I censored your name</br>
            [Boss] : What??</br>
            [Sam]: Max is coming to replace me on duty, he's coming in a few minutes, I agreed with him yesterday, okay bye.</br>
    </p>
    <p>

            And that's how I left there, I had to be 100% ready for the interview.</br>
        </br>
            Everything else is not interesting. The time is now 16:02pm and I'm on my way home... The interview went really badly and there's no way they'll even think about hiring me...</br>
        </br>
            Ok, until the next interview.</br>
        </br>
    </p>
    <p>
            The time is 17:44pm and I'm at home, freaking out about how I messed up.</br>
            Then the cell phone rings and I see that it's my sister (Rose) asking me to come help her move a new couch to her house.</br>
            She bought an apartment for herself last week to be closer to work as a police officer.</br>
            So I leave the house and then I see a post about a missing person on the street light near my house.</br>
            [Sam] : What the..</br>
            The person in the picture is not a child, it is an adult. Was there any kidnapping?</br>
        </br>
            In any case, I guess there is nothing I can do about it and I go to my sister.</br>
            This time I decided to rent the car from the neighbor,</br>
            I have a neighbor who lends his car to neighbors (if the car is damaged, my requirement is to find a way to repair the damage and pay for the repair).</br>
    </p>
    <p>
            In short, I went to my sister's house, the time is 18:39 pm and I am in front of the door of my sister's apartment.</br>
            ....</br>
            [Sam] : Hi</br>
            [Rose] : Hey, what's up?</br>
            [Sam] : Okay, a bit of a bad day, but everything is good, how about you?</br>
            [Rose] : I don't know much pressure from anywhere</br>
            [Sam] : Don't worry the first week in your first apartment is the hardest, you'll get used to it soon</br>
            [Rose] : It's not that, like, but strange things are happening at work now and I'm not sure what's going on.</br>
        </br>
            I helped my sister lift the sofa into the apartment and stayed for a while.</br>
            I turned on the TV and then turned on the news channel...</br>
            [News]: The police have not yet been given any answer regarding the many cases of absences that began to increase in the city in a horrifying manner.</br>
            There are reports from many other cities where similar cases of missing people have occurred.</br>
            And a number of people giving all kinds of conspiracies on the subject such as people who suddenly dissolve ................</br>
        </br>
            I was shocked, there was a bag in the room... my sister looked shocked.</br>
            I turned off the news, my sister asked me to stay, I agreed to stay with her, I just had to wrap up some things with the car and work tomorrow, the neighbor let me keep the car for tomorrow and the boss said he decided to close due to all the terrible cases that are happening now.</br>
        </br>
            It's now 2:00am and I wake up with a strange feeling. I went to drink a glass of water and then wash my face and after that I went back to.............</br>
        </br>
        </br>
            [!@#$%^&^%$#$@%&&%^%$#%&&!!*&!]</br>
        </br>
            Darkness everywhere...</br>
            wind blows...</br>
        </br>
            Emptiness ........</br>
        </br>
            I fall .... I fall ..........................</br>
        </br>
            [!@#$%^&^%$#$@%&&%^%$#%&&!!*&!0ER]</br>
        </br>
            (sound of something falling)</br>
        </br>
            Haha..####.. What just happened, I feel like I just fell a kilometer and I'm still alive.</br>
            Sess... but not completely fine, I hit my knee pretty hard, I don't understand what happened..</br>
            Where am I !</br>
        </br>
            ....</br>
        </br>
            I am surrounded by worn mono-yellow wallpaper walls .. an old damp carpet floor .... I keep hearing a humming noise from the ceiling it must be from the fluorescent lighting ... tile ceiling and so on throughout the place ..</br>
            The place looks like a series of empty rooms or like a maze</br>
        </br>
            I started to move, I just walked without any hesitation with a clear goal... I want to get out of here .............</br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
            I don't know how long it's been but it feels like hours, and I keep walking with no idea how to get out of here... the noise of the fluorescent lights is crazy and I'm getting hungry</br>
            and feels anxious because of the surrounding emptiness and the thought that I might not be able to get out of here.</br>
        </br>
            And so I continue and pen to pen begins to lose the strength to keep going..</br>
        </br>
            (a strange noise is heard)</br>
        </br>
            What do I hear and then this noise is heard again .. I'm starting to think maybe I've gone crazy</br>
            Then ............. it starts to get boring like some machine that goes .. in my direction!</br>
        </br>
            I start to run away and hear the noises getting louder and then a deafening scream is heard from behind like some kind of monster..</br>
        </br>
            I start running with all my might between the walls.. I'm being chased right now and I don't have much strength, is this a nightmare? I want to wake up now, please, #### where am I?!</br>
        </br>
        </br>
            I reached a dead end and immediately changed direction and when I turned to the other direction I saw the monster it looks like a creature made of black cables forming a shape that imitates a human being, four limbs and a head, at least 2 meters tall.</br>
